                This application demonstrates Maven 2 site generation functionalities. One of the nicer features of
                Maven is the ability to create an internal technical web site
                at very little cost. Maven 2 extends this functionality, and gives you powerful new ways
                to generate site content...

                    Team communication is an essential part of any project. And wasting time looking for technical
                    project information can be costly and frustrating. Clearly, any IT project will benefit from
                    having its own dedicated technical web site. Some useful things it provides are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Online javadoc</li>
                        <li>Quality assurance</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Static code audits with Checkstyle or PMD</li>
                            <li>Unit test reports</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
